In line with the aim of the society, we host weekly dinners (and lunches, under special circumstances) at a restaurant of our choice in Cambridge. Anything is possible within the bounds of 'food and drink', so we may look into hosting special wine sessions, socials, and even interviews or host talks by prominent figures in the culinary world. If you are interested in helping us, please [shoot us an email]({{< ref "/contact" >}})!

At present, we are currently trialing and investigating various forms of hosting our weekly dinners. In Lent of 2023, our hope is to begin opening up our dinners to students in the wider University.
