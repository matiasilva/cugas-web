The Cambridge University Gastronomy Society is a society dedicated to the appreciation of good food, drink and company. We publish reviews of all the restaurants we visit with the aim of diversifying the selection of restaurants available to students and staff at the University. We invite all those who enjoy quality food to join us on our gastronomical explorations!

### Our story

Throughout the 2021-2022 academic year, friends Matias and Álvaro would go on dinners on a weekly basis, initially as a way to catch up and unwind after a busy week. United by their Mediterranean backgrounds, they began to take these dinners more seriously with the loose aim of navigating the restaurant landscape in Cambridge. As the list of restaurants visited and friends who joined grew, they realized they could share their love for food and drink with others in the University. They saw an opportunity to promote an appreciation of gastronomy and sought out others who shared this passion. And thus, {{< fancy CUGaS >}} was born.

Even as a formal society, the humble principles it was founded on still stand: quality food, good drink, and even better company.
