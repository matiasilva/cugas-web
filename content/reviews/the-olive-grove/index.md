The Olive Grove is a two-storey, comfortable restaurant that offers traditional Greek dishes along with a wide range of Greek wines.

This is one of those restaurants that you leave wholeheartedly satisfied and content. Despite the relatively large floor space, the interior was well-decorated with a few traces of its Greek origins scattered about. We were well received by the front of house staff and, once seated, quickly lost ourselves in conversation as we explored the menu and recounted the latest happenings in our lives.

Our choices:

* Traditional Greek sharing platter

A good, balanced way to start your meal in this restaurant. The sharing platter is ideal for two or more people as a starter, allowing you to taste a variety of different items the restaurant has to offer, from Greek cheeseballs, tzatziki, olives... accompanied by very good homemade bread. 

* Moussaka

Very good traditional Moussaka. They make individual moussakas baked in the moment to prevent a loss in freshness. Made with fresh aubergine and high quality beef mince. 

* Mixed grill

Definitely the best option for meat lovers. Very well grilled mix of lamb, pork, beef and chicken meats with a flavorful char. Traditional Greek cuts and well seasoned. 

We accompanied our dinner with a bottle of Queen of Hearts: a coupage muscat and *Sauvignon Blanc* fresh white wine, from the Greek winemaker Nico Lazaridi. A wine that has great value for money!

The Olive Grove is a solid choice for a casual dinner with friends or family in a slightly upscale setting.
